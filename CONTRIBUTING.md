## Report Bugs or Raise Issues using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Lyearn/mgod/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](#pr); it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think mthis might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints and follow the [coding style](#rule)
5. Send a pull request to `mgod:main`. Make sure to [allow edits from maintainers][allow-maintainer-edits].

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Embrace **Coding Practices** outlined in [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and adopt the **Best Coding Style Practices** as detailed in the [Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/best-practices.html)

- Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
